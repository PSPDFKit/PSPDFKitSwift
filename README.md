# PSPDFKitSwift

**Note**: [PSPDFKit for iOS](https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/ios/) is a commercial product and requires
a [paid license](https://pspdfkit.com/sales/). Please sign up for a [free trial](http://pspdfkit.com/try)
to receive an evaluation license if you haven't a production license yet.

## Introduction

`PSPDFKitSwift.framework` is a set of wrappers and extensions which improve the Swift experience with PSPDFKit for iOS.

## Usage

To use the Swift wrappers and extensions, you need to import the `PSPDFKitSwift` module.

```swift
import PSPDFKitSwift
```

From now on you can work with the PSPDFKit and PSPDFKitUI frameworks like usually. The only change you will notice are several improvements to the framework APIs when working from Swift. Check the [documentation](./docs) to discover all the wrapped APIs you may want to adopt in your code.

**Note:** There is no need to import the `PSPDFKit` module separately.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have access to PSPDFKit either as a customer or by signing up for a [free trial](https://pspdfkit.com/try/).

### Using CocoaPods

We assume you are familiar with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), otherwise
please consult the documentation first. You'll have to add `PSPDFKitSwift` and `PSPDFKit` as dependancies to your `Podfile`. You also need to add a `post_install` action to install additional resources.

``` Ruby
# Replace `YourAppName` with your app's target name.
target :YourAppName do
  use_frameworks!

  # Replace `YOUR_COCOAPODS_KEY` with your own.
  pod 'PSPDFKit/Swift', podspec: 'https://customers.pspdfkit.com/cocoapods/YOUR_COCOAPODS_KEY/latest.podspec'
end
```

**Note:** make sure to replace `YourAppName` with your app name and
`YOUR_COCOAPODS_KEY` with your own key provided by PSPDFKit GmbH. You can find
your key either in [customer portal](https://customers.pspdfkit.com/) or by
requesting an [evaluation license](https://pspdfkit.com/try/).


Now run `pod install`. Afterwards you should be able to build & run your project
without errors.

### Manual Set-Up

**Note:** Manual set-up is only for experts, we assume you know what you are
doing. If you are unsure, please use CocoaPods or Carthage instead.

First, build the PSPDFKitSwift framework:

* Clone `git@github.com:PSPDFKit/PDFKitSwift.git`
* Copy `PSPDFKit.framework` into `PSPDFKitSwift/Frameworks`
* Copy `PSPDFKitUI.framework` into `PSPDFKitSwift/Frameworks`
* Open the terminal and `cd` into the `PSPDFKitSwift` directory
* Run `rake compile`

You should now have the `PDFFKitSwift.framework` in the `Build` folder. Next, add
the `PSPDFKit.framework`,`PSPDFKitUI.framework` and `PDFFKitSwift.framework` to your project:

* Follow the [*Getting Started*](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/getting-started/integrating-pspdfkit/) instructions for PSPDFKit.

* Perform steps (1) and (2) from the above *Getting Started* guide, Section
  [Integrating the Dynamic Framework](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/getting-started/integrating-pspdfkit/#toc_integrating-the-dynamic-framework),
  and add PSPDFKitSwift to your app similar to how you did it with PSPDFKit above. You
  may also want to set up your [test targets](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/getting-started/integrating-pspdfkit/#toc_test-targets) accordingly.
  **Note:** make sure to adapt the path for the "Run Script" build phase for PSPDFKitSwift.

You should now be able to build & run your app.

**Important:** Link against frameworks from the `Frameworks` directory as those are patched bundles. Compiling PSPDFKitSwift modifies `PSPDFKit.framework` and `PSPDFKitUI.framework` by adding `.apinotes` files to both. If you copy those modified frameworks to any other Swift projects, be sure to also include PSPDFKitSwift, as they will no longer work without that additional library.

## Limitations

We plan to further evolve PSPDFKitSwift and do not yet guarantee API stability. This shouldn't stop you from using it, as changes will usually be easy to adopt.

## Contributing

If you want to work on PSPDFKitSwift, perform the following steps:

* Clone `git@github.com:PSPDFKit/PSPDFKitSwift.git`
* Copy `PSPDFKit.framework` into `PSPDFKitSwift/Frameworks`
* Copy `PSPDFKitUI.framework` into `PSPDFKitSwift/Frameworks`
* Open `PSPDFKitSwift.xcodeproj` in Xcode >= 9

Please [sign our CLA agreement](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/web/current/miscellaneous/contributing/) so we can accept your pull requests.

Technical notes:

* All PSPDFKitSwift source files live in the `Sources` directory.
* PSPDFKit and PSPDFKitUI modules are re-exported automatically.
* `PSPDFKit.apinotes` and `PSPDFKitUI.apinotes` are textile files that adjust the API visibility.

## Known Issues

**Linker warning when building without Carthage**. In order to support Carthage
out-of-the-box with per-customer PSPDFKit URLs, we've added the _parent_
Carthage build folder to the "Framework Search Paths". When building without
Carthage, this produces the following warning:

```
ld: warning: directory not found for option '-F/Users/desktopuser/Projects/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKitSwift/../../../Carthage/Build/iOS'
```

## License

PSPDFKitSwift is released under a modified version of the BSD license, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
